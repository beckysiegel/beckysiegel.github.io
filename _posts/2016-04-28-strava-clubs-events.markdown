As a way to experiment with react native, I created a mobile application using the Strava API.  This fills a void left by Stravaâ€™s club feature. A user can join many clubs. Each club can post events and announcements, but there is not a place where a user can view an aggregated view of events and announcements for all of their clubs. Rather, they can only see information by clicking on one at a time.

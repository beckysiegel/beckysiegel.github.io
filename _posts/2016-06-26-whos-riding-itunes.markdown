In my last post, I talked about an app I was submitting to the iTunes store.

The app was rejected twice. First, was for the name (it contained Strava, and also redirected the user to Safari to authenticate). I then changed the name, and added a login button. They still rejected it for the redirect. Finally, I used the Safari View Controller for the login instead of opening up the Safari app. It was finally approved:
